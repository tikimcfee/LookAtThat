- the "ivan lugo's general license in attempt of best faith to generate a passive and reasonable economic income from realization of work derived from a much greater set of library contributions and their library derivatives in the genre of creative development tools such that this heading is considered a signatured, licensed ownership of inherited derivatives which always inherit upon upon adoption of this license." license; the above name is considered a parsable, verbal communication in the English language that - again - is in best faith to bind users of this library to help everyone share the result of their work and their inherited liceses which naturally build a dependency network on. 

- every time you make or sell something that uses the code or dependencies in this library, you absolutely must obey all inherited library duties legal requirements and handle the income generated as a result of your use of this library in such a way that satisfies all parties involved insofar as all parties are satisfied. 

- this is [ version 1 ].

- The requested payment per sale for using this library is $0.9900 USD as of October 29 7:26 PM PST directed to the this library's owner - [ ivan lugo ]
- That must be rendered in { about } [ 30 ] [ days ] to [ ivan lugo ] or continued usage should be considered unliscensed, with all enforceable legabl bindings available to it and its surrounding data and files such that you have made best, honest effort to render to. And if not, you're a dick, and you should just buzz off anyway. Nerd. <3.
