V and U are only varieties of the same character, U being the cursive form, while V is better adapted for engraving, as in stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel / (see Y), this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u, w, f, b, p; as in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save; trover, troubadour, trope. See U, F, etc.</P><P><B>V</B> (<I></I>) As a numeral, V stands for five, in English and Latin.</P><P><B>Vaagmer</B> (<I>n.</I>) The dealfish.</P><P><B>Vacancies</B> (<I>pl. </I>) of Vacancy</P><P><B>Vacancy</B> (<I>n.</I>) The quality or state of being vacant; emptiness; hence, freedom from employment; intermission; leisure; idleness; listlessness.</P><P><B>Vacancy</B> (<I>n.</I>) That which is vacant.</P><P><B>Vacancy</B> (<I>n.</I>) Empty space; vacuity; vacuum.</P><P><B>Vacancy</B> (<I>n.</I>) An open or unoccupied space between bodies or things; an interruption of continuity; chasm; gap; as, a vacancy between buildings; a vacancy between sentences or thoughts.</P><P><B>Vacancy</B> (<I>n.</I>) Unemployed time; interval of leisure; time of intermission; vacation.</P><P><B>Vacancy</B> (<I>n.</I>) A place or post unfilled; an unoccupied office; as, a vacancy in the senate, in a school, etc.</P><P><B>Vacant</B> (<I>a.</I>) Deprived of contents; not filled; empty; as, a vacant room.</P><P><B>Vacant</B> (<I>a.</I>) Unengaged with business or care; unemployed; unoccupied; disengaged; free; as, vacant hours.</P><P><B>Vacant</B> (<I>a.</I>) Not filled or occupied by an incumbent, possessor, or officer; as, a vacant throne; a vacant parish.</P><P><B>Vacant</B> (<I>a.</I>) Empty of thought; thoughtless; not occupied with study or reflection; as, a vacant mind.</P><P><B>Vacant</B> (<I>a.</I>) Abandoned; having no heir, possessor, claimant, or occupier; as, a vacant estate.</P><P><B>Vacantly</B> (<I>adv.</I>) In a vacant manner; inanely.</P><P><B>Vacated</B> (<I>imp. & p. p.</I>) of Vacate</P><P><B>Vacating</B> (<I>p. pr. & vb. n.</I>) of Vacate</P><P><B>Vacate</B> (<I>v. t.</I>) To make vacant; to leave empty; to cease from filling or occupying; as, it was resolved by Parliament that James had vacated the throne of England; the tenant vacated the house.</P><P><B>Vacate</B> (<I>v. t.</I>) To annul; to make void; to deprive of force; to make of no authority or validity; as, to vacate a commission or a charter; to vacate proceedings in a cause.</P><P><B>Vacate</B> (<I>v. t.</I>) To defeat; to put an end to.</P><P><B>Vacation</B> (<I>n.</I>) The act of vacating; a making void or of no force; as, the vacation of an office or a charter.</P><P><B>Vacation</B> (<I>n.</I>) Intermission of a stated employment, procedure, or office; a period of intermission; rest; leisure.</P><P><B>Vacation</B> (<I>n.</I>) Intermission of judicial proceedings; the space of time between the end of one term and the beginning of the next; nonterm; recess.</P><P><B>Vacation</B> (<I>n.</I>) The intermission of the regular studies and exercises of an educational institution between terms; holidays; as, the spring vacation.</P><P><B>Vacation</B> (<I>n.</I>) The time when an office is vacant; esp.
