(See<A HREF="http://www.promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenburg</A>)</P><P>This version has been extensively stripped down and set out as onedefinition per line. All the Gutenburg EText tags and formatting havebeen removed by computer. Version 0.03 is a new processing of v0.47of the websters dictionary and it has considerably fewer errors. Alsothe definition limit of 255 chars has been removed to give fulljustice of some of the more majestic of the originals. Some importanterrors in the parts-of-speech fields have been corrected and a lot ofinflections/ alternatives and plurals that were missed due tosoftware bugs in v0.01 and 0.02 are now included properly.</P><P>The dictionary is set as a word list with definitions, usingminimal HTML markup. The only tags used are &lt;P&gt;, &lt;B&gt; and&lt;I&gt; and these serve to delimit the words (between &lt;B&gt;s)the part of speech or type (between &lt;I&gt;s) and the definitions(The rest of the line). Each entry is between a &lt;P&gt;, &lt;/P&gt;pair. This will facilitate computer processing. The text was preparedon a macintosh, so the few accented and umlauted characters appearbest if your browser is set to Western MacRoman encoding (this shouldlook like an umlauted u : <B>&uuml;</B>). If this causes problems andI get enough responses, I'll look into producing an ISO 8859-1 oreven a Unicode version.</P><P>The dictionary can be viewed (with patience) directly online asyou would a normal printed dictionary, otherwise a user can downloadthe pages and process them in some way on their own machine. The onlyusage conditions are that if the material is redistributed, thecontent (not the formatting) remain in the public domain (ie free)and that the content be easily accessible in non-encoded plain textformat at no cost to the end user. The origin of the content shouldalso be acknowledged, including OPTED, Project Gutenburg and the 1913edition of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. If the material is to beincluded in commercial products, Project Gutenburg should becontacted first. There are no restrictions for personal or researchuses of this material.</P><P>Please email:<A HREF="mailto:Ralph.Sutherland@anu.edu.au">Ralph.Sutherland@anu.edu.au</A>if you plan to download OPTED so I can keep track of interested usersfor updates and so forth.</P><H3>OPTED v0.03 by Letter(size)</H3><P>First <I>raw</I> computer generated version:</P><P><A HREF="v003/wb1913_a.html">A(1.1M)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_b.html">B(1005k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_c.html">C(1.6M)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_d.html">D(1M)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_e.html">E(809k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_f.html">F(784k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_g.html">G(564k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_h.html">H(686k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_i.html">I(833k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_j.html">J(172k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_k.html">K(172k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_l.html">L(637k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_m.html">M(931k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_n.html">N(343k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_o.html">O(466k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_p.html">P(1.5M)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_q.html">Q(147k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_r.html">R(931k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_s.html">S(2.1M)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_t.html">T(1005k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_u.html">U(343k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_v.html">V(343k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_w.html">W(490k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_x.html">X(49k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_y.html">Y(74k)</A> |<A HREF="v003/wb1913_z.html">Z(74k)</A></P><H3>OPTED v0.03 by Archive</H3><P>OPTED v0.03can also be downloaded as a<A HREF="optedv003.hqx">large stuffit/binhex encoded archive</A>.(6MB/ 15.6M unpacked)</P><P>A good starting point for people interested in other English wordlists are these two sites:</P><UL>   <LI><A HREF="http://www.cix.co.uk/~bryson/wordlist.html">The UK   Advanced Cryptics Dictionary</A>      <LI><A HREF="http://personal.riverusers.com/~thegrendel/">ENABLE</A></UL><P>Last Updated: 19th November 1998</P></BODY></HTML>
